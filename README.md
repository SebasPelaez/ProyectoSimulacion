# Predictive models: Parkinson's disease

## Introduction

The problem that we will address is related to Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative condition that affects more than one million people in the United States and whose risk of diagnosis increases dramatically after 50 years.

Today there are different techniques and scales to measure the level of progress that has Parkinson's disease on a person, the best known of which is the UPDRS scale (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) which evaluates 3 aspects:
1. Behavior and state of encouragement
2. Daily activities
3. Motor skills

Keeping in mind that multiple difficulties that can arise from obtaining a diagnosis with the UPDRS scale, it is necessary to develop tools and models that allow an effective and as far as possible, non-invasive measurement. That is why Telemedicine and the Machine learning techniques emerge as a powerful alternatives.

Having said this and taking into account the measurement characteristics with which a patient in the UPDRS scale is evaluated, it is possible to design a machine learning model that allows to predict the level of advancement of Parkinson's disease on a patient. It is for this reason that we will address a regression problem for which we will adjust a model that allows us to predict two values on the UPDRS scale: The total score and the score for the motor test. With all of that, we hope that we can determine the level of advancement of Parkinson's disease in a new patient.
